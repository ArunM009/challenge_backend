# Challenge 1: REST API for Transaction Data

## Objective
Develop a set of RESTful endpoints to manage transaction data, including create, read, update, and delete operations.

## Tasks
1. **API Enhancement**: Extend the existing API to support POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
2. **Data Handling**: Ensure all operations correctly modify and fetch data from a local JSON file, `transactions.json`.
3. **Testing**: Write basic tests to validate each endpoint.

## Setup
- Clone the repository and set up your Python environment.
- The starter code is available in `main.py` and `transactions.py`.

## Execution
- Implement the missing CRUD operations in the `transactions.py` file.
- Ensure the JSON data correctly reflects changes made by API calls.
- Write test cases to validate the functionality of all endpoints.

## Submission
Submit the updated Python scripts that demonstrate fully functional CRUD operations.

## Evaluation
Your implementation will be evaluated based on:
- Functionality: All API endpoints must perform the expected tasks correctly.
- Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-organized, and properly commented.
- Robustness: Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages.

This challenge tests your backend development skills, specifically in creating and managing API services.
