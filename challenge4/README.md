# Challenge 4: PDF Data Extraction

## Objective
Construct a script to extract text and tables from a PDF document and save the results in JSON format.

## Tasks
1. **Text Extraction**: Implement logic to extract and accumulate text from the PDF.
2. **Table Extraction**: Transform table rows into dictionary format and gather.
3. **Output Data**: Output both types of data into a well-structured JSON file.

## Execution
- Modify `main4.py` to specify paths for the input PDF and the output JSON.
- Complete the TODO sections within the script to perform the necessary data extraction and saving.

## Submission
Submit the fully functional script that can effectively extract information and save it correctly.

## Evaluation
Your script will be evaluated based on:
- Accuracy and completeness of the data extraction.
- Code efficiency and readability.
- Robustness in handling different PDF structures.

This challenge tests your ability to automate data extraction, a key skill in data processing tasks.
