# Challenge 2: Frequency Analysis

## Objective
Write a Python script to find the integer with the third highest frequency in a list.

## Tasks
1. **Algorithm Development**: Implement a function to determine the integer frequency.
2. **Data Handling**: Identify the integer that appears as the third most frequent in the provided list.
3. **Output**: Print the result to the console.

## Preparation
- Ensure your environment is set up for Python development.
- Use the provided `data.json` file for the list of integers.

## Execution
- Implement the necessary logic in `third_highest_frequency.py`.
- Ensure your solution is efficient and handles various edge cases such as ties in frequency.

## Submission
Submit the script that accurately identifies and outputs the third most frequent integer.

## Evaluation
Submissions will be assessed based on:
- Correct implementation of the frequency analysis.
- Efficiency of the solution.
- Code clarity and organization.

Demonstrate your ability to manipulate and analyze data effectively with this challenge.
